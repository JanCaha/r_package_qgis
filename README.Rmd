# qgis

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

**qgis** is automatically generated package which originates from [qgisprocess](https://github.com/paleolimbot/qgisprocess) and aims to provide calls and simple documentation for each [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) functions available in core and the most important algorithm providers ([GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) and [Saga](http://www.saga-gis.org/)). The algorithms are automatically extracted from fresh install of latest **QGIS** version on **Ubuntu** with packages for **GRASS** and **SAGA** installed.

The package is highly experimental and things are quite likely to change a lot in the future. The definition of individual functions can change if it changes in the QGIS.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **qgis** from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.package("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JanCaha/r_package_qgis")
```

The information about local installation are in a vignette `vignette("local_instalation")`.

## Functions names

The names of the functions follow general pattern of `algorithm-provider_algorithm-id` with only the native **QGIS** algorithms using `qgis` algorithm provider instead of `native`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
algs <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data-raw", "algorithms.csv"))
```

The available providers are: `r glue::glue_collapse(unique(algs$provider), sep = ", ")`. The overall number of available algorithms is `r nrow(algs)`.

## Example

The package is not meant to be load directly as this would significant number of functions (<900). Instead the functions should be called as: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qgis::qgis_buffer()
```

This allows you to show the help page for the function (at least in **RStudio** using the key shortcut **F1**).

## Example in the wild

This example uses `qgisprocess` pipe ability to directly load output to **R**.

```{r}
library(sf)

fname <- system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf")
nc <- st_read(fname)

buffered <- qgis::qgis_buffer(INPUT = nc, 
                              DISTANCE = 0.5, 
                              END_CAP_STYLE = "Flat") %>% 
  st_as_sf()

plot(buffered)
```
