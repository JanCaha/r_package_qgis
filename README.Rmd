**qgis** is automatically generated package which originates from [qgisprocess](https://github.com/paleolimbot/qgisprocess) and aims to provide calls and simple documentation for each [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) functions available in core and the most important algorithm providers ([GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) and [Saga](http://www.saga-gis.org/)). The algorithms are automatically extracted from fresh install of latest **QGIS** version on **Ubuntu** with packages for **GRASS** and **SAGA** installed.

The package is highly experimental and things are quite likely to change a lot in the future. The definition of individual functions can change if it changes in the QGIS.

## Latest version

Latest package version **`r desc::desc_get_field("Version")`** is build against QGIS version **`r qgisprocess::qgis_version()`**.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **qgis** from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.package("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JanCaha/r_package_qgis")
```

The information about local installation are in a vignette `vignette("local_instalation")`.

## Functions names

The names of the functions follow general pattern of `algorithm-provider_algorithm-id` with only the native **QGIS** algorithms using `qgis` algorithm provider instead of `native`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
algs <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data-raw", "algorithms.csv"))
```

The available providers are: `r glue::glue_collapse(unique(algs$provider), sep = ", ")`. The overall number of available algorithms is `r nrow(algs)`.

## Functions parameters

Every functions carries three boolean parameters that allow better utilization of these functions in R pipelines and reports. These are `.complete_output`, `.quiet` and `.messages`. The default setting of these variables is such that the calls are as silent as possible and create pretty much no output in R console at all.

Parameter `.quiet` (default values is `TRUE`) is the same as in `qgisprocess::qgis_run_algorithm()` only in `qgis` the functions are silent by default while in `qgisprocess` they are talkative.

Parameter `.messages` (default value is `FALSE`) controls if messages produced by `qgisprocess` (such as information about parameters not being set etc.) should be outputed or not.

Parameter `.complete_output`(default values is `TRUE`) specifies whether whole QGIS process output should be returned or only first variable in it, which is usually the main output.

These three parameters can also be set as R session options using `options(qgis.quiet = TRUE)`, `options(qgis.messages = FALSE)` and `options(qgis.complete_output = TRUE)` to avoid the need to set them for every individual function call.

## Example

The package is not meant to be load directly as this would significant number of functions (<900). Instead the functions should be called as: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qgis::qgis_buffer()
```

This allows you to show the help page for the function (at least in **RStudio** using the key shortcut **F1**).

## Example in the wild

This example uses `qgisprocess` pipe ability to directly load output to **R**.

```{r}
library(sf)

nc <- st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"), quiet = TRUE)

buffered <- qgis::qgis_buffer(INPUT = nc, 
                              DISTANCE = 0.2, 
                              END_CAP_STYLE = "Flat") %>% 
  st_as_sf()

plot(buffered["NAME"])
```
