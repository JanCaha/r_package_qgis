# qgis

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

**qgis** is automatically generated package which originates from [qgisprocess](https://github.com/paleolimbot/qgisprocess) and aims to provide calls and simple documentation for each [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) functions available in core and the most important algorithm providers ([GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) and [Saga](http://www.saga-gis.org/)).

The package is highly experimental and things are quite likely to change a lot in the future. The definition of individual functions can change if it changes in the QGIS.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **qgis** from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.package("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JanCaha/r_package_qgis")
```

## Example

The package is not meant to be load directly as this would significant number of functions (<900). Instead the functions should be called as: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
qgis::qgis_buffer()
```

## Example in the wild

This example uses `qgisprocess` pipe ability to directly load output to **R**.

```{r}
library(sf)

fname <- system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf")
nc <- st_read(fname)

buffered <- qgis::qgis_buffer(INPUT = nc, 
                              DISTANCE = 0.5, 
                              END_CAP_STYLE = "Flat") %>% 
  st_as_sf()

plot(buffered)
```
